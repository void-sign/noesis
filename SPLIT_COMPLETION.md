# Noesis Repository Split - Completion Summary

## Overview
The Noesis project has been successfully separated into two distinct repositories:
1. **Noesis Core** - https://github.com/void-sign/noesis
2. **Noesis-Extend** - https://github.com/void-sign/noesis-extend

This separation was completed to:
- Provide clearer licensing boundaries (Noesis License vs MIT License)
- Allow independent development and versioning
- Simplify dependency management
- Better support different use cases

## Completed Tasks

### Directory Structure
- Created a clean separation between core and extensions
- Moved all quantum and tools code to Noesis-Extend repository
- Reorganized directory structure for better organization

### Build System
- Updated Makefiles in both repositories
- Created shared library build for core components
- Added environment variable support for cross-repository dependencies
- Created bin and lib directories for cleaner organization

### Scripts
- Created `install_dependency.fish` script for fetching core from extensions
- Updated `link_libraries.fish` to work across repositories
- Created `run.fish` script for Noesis-Extend
- Updated `run_core.fish` for Noesis
- Created `launch_noesis_env.fish` scripts to aid development

### Documentation
- Updated READMEs in both repositories
- Created MIGRATION.md guide for users
- Added CONTRIBUTING.md with repository-specific guidelines
- Updated CHANGELOG_v1.0.0.md in both repositories

### Developer Tools
- Updated VS Code tasks.json in both repositories
- Added VS Code launch.json for debugging in Noesis-Extend
- Fixed path references in issue templates

### Cleanup
- Created cleanup_extensions.fish script to remove extensions from core repository
- Updated links and references throughout the codebase
- Ensured all mentions of 'yourusername' are replaced with 'void-sign'

## Next Steps

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Create actual GitHub repositories at void-sign/noesis and void-sign/noesis-extend
   - Push initial commits to both repositories

2. **CI/CD**
   - Set up GitHub Actions for both repositories
   - Create automated build and test workflows

3. **Releases**
   - Create v1.0.0 releases for both repositories
   - Add appropriate tags

4. **User Communication**
   - Announce the repository split
   - Share migration guide with users
